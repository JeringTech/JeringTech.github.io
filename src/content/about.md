Jering is an open-core software company founded in 2018 and based in Singapore.

Here at Jering, we're excited about WASM. In the near future, it will have a significant impact on web and general 
application development. For that reason, we're working toward building tools and services around it.

In 2018, we started putting together the infrastructure for our development activities. This year (2019), we plan 
to complete said infrastructure. Also, we plan to lay the groundwork for our WASM tools and services. Along the way, 
we'll be publishing [utilities](/utilities), [guides](/guides), and [articles](/articles).

We sincerely hope you find our work to be of use. Thanks for visiting!
