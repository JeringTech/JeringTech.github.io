Jering is an open-core software company founded in 2018 and based in Singapore.  

Here at Jering, we're excited about WASM's potential.
We think it will have a significant impact on web and general application development in the near future. 
For that reason, we're working toward building tools and services around WASM.  

In 2018, we began putting together the infrastructure for our development activities. In 2019, we plan to complete our infrastructure and to begin 
laying the groundwork for our WASM tools and services. Along the way, we're publishing [utilities](/utilities), [guides](/guides) and [articles](/articles).

We sincerely hope that you find our work to be of use. Thanks for visiting!
